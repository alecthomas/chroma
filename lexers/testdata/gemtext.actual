=> gemini://geminiprotocol.net/docs/gemtext-specification.gmi

=> gemini://geminiprotocol.net/docs/gemtext-specification.gmi Here is a friendly link to the Gemtext specification

=> https://geminiprotocol.net/docs/gemtext-specification.gmi gemini protocol isn't special for links

=> gemini://geminiprotocol.net/	multiple kinds of whitespace

=>  gemini://geminiprotocol.net/	 multiple whitespace between parts!

=> /foo/bar/baz.txt leading slash still counts

Links may also be closer together. Here are some examples from the spec:
=> gemini://example.org/
=> gemini://example.org/ An example link
=> gemini://example.org/foo	Another example link at the same host
=> foo/bar/baz.txt	A relative link
=> 	gopher://example.org:70/1 A gopher link

=>this shouldn't be a link, but it is. 
=>gemini://example.org/ the leading space is optional

Syntax highlighting may be applied to preformatted blocks:
```javascript
	column.substring(0,num)
```

The spec says, "Any text following the leading "```" of a preformat toggle line MUST be ignored by clients." So...
