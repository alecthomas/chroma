# You are reading a comment in ".properties" file.
! The exclamation mark can also be used for comments.
# Lines with "properties" contain a key and a value separated by a delimiting character.
# There are 3 delimiting characters: '=' (equal), ':' (colon) and whitespace (space, \t and \f).

# White space that appears between the key, the value and the delimiter is ignored.
# This means that the following are equivalent (other than for readability).
hello=hello
hello = hello
topic .properties files
# A word on a line will just create a key with no value.
empty
# Keys with the same name will be overwritten by the key that is the furthest in a file.
# For example the final value for "duplicateKey" will be "second".
duplicateKey = first
duplicateKey = second
# Adding a \ at the end of a line means that the value continues to the next line.
towLines = This line \
           continues
threeLines: This value \
            has even \
            three lines
# If you need to add newlines and carriage returns, they need to be escaped using \n and \r respectively.
# You can also optionally escape tabs with \t for readability purposes.
valueWithEscapes = This is a newline\n and a carriage return\r and a tab\t.
# You can also use Unicode escape characters (maximum of four hexadecimal digits).
# In the following example, the value for "encodedHelloInJapanese" is "こんにちは".
encodedHelloInJapanese = \u3053\u3093\u306b\u3061\u306f
# But with more modern file encodings like UTF-8, you can directly use supported characters.
helloInJapanese = こんにちは
  # Comments and keys can have leading whitespace
  foo = I have leading whitespace
# Comments and keys can have trailing whitespace as part of the comment   
bar = I have trailing whitespace as part of the value
