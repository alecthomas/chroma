# Hello there!
This is a playground for ''Markless''(https://shirakumo.org/docs/markless, color red, large), a //text based// **markup language** intended for __simple__ document and comment publications.

Markless is a relatively new[1] markup standard that focuses on being intuitive first and fast for computers to process second. Being a purely text-based markup, no complicated editor software is required to create documents in it, any simple text editor will do. v(Though of course, having syntax highlighting and previews are nice.)

[1] Development of the standard started in 2015

The Markless standard does not specify its results based on another document format, meaning that an implementation could be written to turn a Markless document into practically any other format[2]. Markless is strict and does not allow for any ambiguities in its markup. This should both make it less confusing for you, and easier to parse for a computer program.

[2] While the output here is HTML, cl-markless for instance can also translate to BBCode, LaTeX, and EPUB, among other formats.
